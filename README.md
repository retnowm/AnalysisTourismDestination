## Problem
Indonesia is a country with a plethora of captivating attractions, ranging from beautiful mountains and serene beaches to culturally rich historical landmarks and much more. The growth in tourist arrivals in 2023 has shown an increase, meeting and even surpassing the government's targets. However, compared to other countries in ASEAN, the growth of tourism in Indonesia remains relatively slow.

## Overview Dataset

- tourism_with_id.csv: Information about tourist attractions in the 5 major cities in Indonesia.
- user.csv: Information about user data with a total of 300 users.
- tourism_rating.csv: Information about users, places, and ratings for tourist destinations.

## Insight
Based on the analysis using Python and visualization using Tableau, several insights can be derived:

1. Yogyakarta and Bandung are the favorite cities for tourist destinations, with the highest average number of visits. Meanwhile, Surabaya, despite having visitors in each tourism category, has a relatively low number of visits, making it the city with the lowest tourism traffic.
2. Semarang has the lowest ratings despite having a decent level of visits. Therefore, there is a need for an improvement in the quality of tourism in Semarang to increase the number of tourist visits.
3. The Natural Reserve category has the highest number of visits, with many tourists from major cities choosing this category to escape the hustle and bustle of urban areas. Therefore, implementing proper maintenance and improvements can enhance both the rating and the number of visits.
4. High ratings for Religious Places can increase the number of visitors, especially if events are held at these locations, such as lectures featuring renowned speakers or other activities.

5. The number of visits to free destinations (3,182) is less than that of paid destinations (6,818). This suggests that tourists are willing to spend money to enjoy the attractions they want to visit.
6. However, paid attractions have a lower rating compared to free destinations. Therefore, improvements and maintenance of facilities or paid attractions should be carried out to be comparable to what is paid for and to satisfy the visiting tourists, leading to an increase in visits.
7. There are 4 free destinations with a rating of 5, namely Culinary Tour Pacenongan, Freedom Library, Sungan Code Yogyakarta Village, and Kauman Pakualam Yogyakarta. There is a need for more promotion to increase visits to these destinations. Due to their high ratings, these destinations deserve more attention.

In summary, it is suggested to invest in the improvement of paid attractions to enhance their ratings and to focus on promoting the free destinations with high ratings to attract more visitors.
